# Olympos
Here's a quick project I built for the Greek Myths class I took at UH. Margins aren't mobile optimized (I only had to project it onto a screen), but definitely still usable.

Mostly some pictures and fun facts about Olympos, Greece. I just wanted to make something more technically neat than a brochure in Word.
